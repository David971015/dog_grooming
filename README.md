# dog_grooming
It`s an app where I implement a CRUD using my sql as dataBase , JPA provider ->eclipselink and SWING as grafic interface. In  this app you can register the data for each client(pet and owner), also you can filter all data in the table to see the information that you are looking for.

#connection_to_database
For connection it,s very simple: 
- download driver/library for working with my sql: connector
- create the database on the database provider you use
- do the connection with the project in netbeans -> services .
